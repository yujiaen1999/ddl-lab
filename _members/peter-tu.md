Hi, I’m Peter, a graduate student in Computer Science who’s interested in building systems that connect technology with human behavior. I’ve worked on a mix of software engineering, data-driven projects, and applied machine learning, including full-stack and distributed systems. I enjoy turning ideas into practical tools, especially when they have real-world impact and are designed with users in mind.
