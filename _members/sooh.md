Hello! I am specialized in Computer Science (CS) education. I am passionate in conducting CS education research as a means to push for diversity and equity in CS programs. I am currently affiliated with The CSEd Research Lab in University of California at San Diego. Before joining UCSD, which is my PhD alma mater, I worked at Princeton University as teaching faculty.

I love to travel around the world, although I won’t be able to anytime soon thanks to my 2 year old. I have visited all continents but one – Antarctica!
