Hi there! My name is Yiqing Li, and I go by Brenda. I’m a second-year PhD student at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. My research focuses on computing education, where I build tools that integrate evidence-based psychological interventions to promote effective study behaviors and improve academic outcomes.

I love teaching and I love working with kids! I currently serve as the Regional Manager for [DataJam](https://www.thedatajam.org/), where I support students and oversee operations across the state. I also lead the development of the *Data in Action* curriculum, which connects high school students with local businesses and teaches students to apply business analytics to solve real business problems.

In my free time, I like working out, going to concerts, and volunteering!
